# Parth.ai 🪶

*Your personal AI guide for goals and growth*

Named after Lord Krishna (Parth - another name for Arjuna's chariot driver), this AI companion guides you toward your goals with wisdom, timely nudges, and unwavering support.

## What It Does

- **Track Goals**: Set and manage multiple goals with intelligent context awareness
- **Proactive Guidance**: Receives timely check-ins and encouragement (not just when you ask)
- **Adaptive Learning**: Understands your patterns, preferences, and what motivates you
- **Smart Memory**: Remembers your progress, struggles, and wins across all goals

## How It Works

Parth learns what you need for each goal and stores relevant context autonomously. Whether it's tracking weight, building habits, or learning new skills - it adapts its guidance to what matters for *your* journey.

Like Krishna guiding Arjuna, Parth doesn't make decisions for you - it helps you see clearly and stay on course.
